Stella by Starlight: a round geometric visualizer + sky chart inspired by [Stella (HypMic)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CYZfhj-LDRk)

Uses [Heavens-Above's old sky chart](https://heavens-above.com/SkyChart.aspx?)

(Credit to mak_kawa on the Rainmeter forums for the MJD measures)

See [colorpresetshelp.txt](https://github.com/Halloyo/StellaVisualizer/blob/master/colorpresetshelp.txt) to see different color presets for the charts.

There might be times when the sky chart doesn't download after refreshing the skin, if that happens, please close and re-open Rainmeter.
